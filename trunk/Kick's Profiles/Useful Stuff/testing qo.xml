QuestId 13086
Purpose:
[8:32:18 PM] Kickazz006: alright what i need it to do is if i'm not in a vehicle, go to X and interact (sometimes you get blown out of vehicle if flying guy is attacking your tower)

!isinvehicle takes priority

in vehicle - objective 2 - auto angle and just hit 1 then 2 repeatedly until objective 2 is done (on mobM) then same for objective 1 on mobN

http://www.wowhead.com/quest=13086 for more details

basically - fly up to cannon, mount it, kill drakes (3), kill noob npcs (100)

Example Task: Use Cannon for task (cannon is basically a 'straight fire' - no crazy angles; it angles down a little, but not too much)
Req Var:  
QuestId 
MobIdn (for multiple)
ObjectiveId would be nice - but not required
VehId - for mounting and when you get punted out
XYZ is the general area - there are 4 'towers' where cannons are and the bot needs to fly up to there and mount it by itself (a new one each time)

Drake: 30575
MobId2: 30593

the cannon needs to be able to auto-fire at targets by itself (not just in a straight line - they move a lot)
