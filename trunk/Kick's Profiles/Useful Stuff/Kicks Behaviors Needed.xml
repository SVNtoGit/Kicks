Kick's Vehicle Behaviors QQ:


<!-- Non-cata - Vehicles -->


 I need some sort of a combat UseItemTargetLocation
		<PickUp QuestName="The Endless Flow" QuestId="27161" GiverName="Lang Loosegrip" GiverId="44467" />
I think natfoth was fiddling with this... he may have even made it, but I don't have the behavior or syntax


flying vehicle quest in burning steppes.  I have this quest kind of scripted - but there are minor issues with it
		<PickUp QuestName="Assault on Dreadmaul Rock" QuestId="28320" GiverName="John J. Keeshan" GiverId="48306" />
the flying vehicle flies around but singular keeps wanting to target shit and kill it ... and it interrupts the behavior
		
		
ol'blasty moving boat in s.stv
		<PickUp QuestName="Ol' Blasty" QuestId="26647" GiverName="Ironpatch" GiverId="2547" />
moving cannon on a boat shooting at moving target


and then another quest w/ that cannon on stationary targets


redridge commando quest x2
		<PickUp QuestName="Prisoners of War" QuestId="26646" GiverName="John J. Keeshan" GiverId="43458" />
King scripted the 2 quests but he had issues...so I just kinda skipped them while i was developing
