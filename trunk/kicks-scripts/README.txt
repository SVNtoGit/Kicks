Hi, all,

We have moved the location of the Profile Pack to a new location:
    https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/buddy-profiles.honorbuddy/trunk

The "Obtaining a Copy of the Profiles" post (http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/honorbuddy-profiles/131188-kicks-1-90-mega-profile-pack.html#post1259749) has been updated to reflect this change.

Please delete your local copy of the profile pack, and download a fresh copy from the new location.  Other than server location, nothing has changed.  We will be retiring the old Google repository, and using the new one from Assembla from now on.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

cheers,
chinajade
